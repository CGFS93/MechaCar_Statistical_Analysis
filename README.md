## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
